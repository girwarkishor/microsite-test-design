## Design

### Colors

Kotak Group has a well established color palette which consumers associate with the brand. In the digital realm, colors have certain strong meanings. Keeping with the brand's appearance, an extended palette has been made available to designers offering some leg room to stretch those creative muscles.

#### Guidelines

These guidelines are the framework upon which we have built the system for how colors are to be used for all Kotak Securities products.

##### Significance over aesthetic

Use of color should be with a purpose and should be supported with a rational. At no juncture, should you feel a compulsion to use color while designing products for Kotak Securities. For all general purposes, the below quote is applicable

> "White space is to be regarded as an active element, not a passive background."

##### Colors should drive attention

Colors help create a visual heirarchy just as typography does. Use it to drive focus. Be cautious of how you use it.

#### Color Palette

We have 6 palettes of colors available for our use. Kotak brand has a warm primary palette and cool secondary palette. Using combinations of hues available in the primary palette and similarly in the secondary palette, a gradient palette has been derived. A standard greyscale palette is also available. To add a touch of freshness, there is a fresh colors palette. To communicate topics of lower importance, we have a muted palette.

#### Color Combinations

#### Color Usage

##### Shades and Tones

Shades and tones of the Primary, Secondary and Fallback palettes can be used by varying opacities on a black or white backgrounds. That said, we recommend that you avoid the use of shades and insist that you use tones of colors provided in the palette. We strongly advocate against the use of blend modes for pop effects.

#### Accessibility

The average customer of Kotak Securities is 34 years old. This means a decent contrast value is needed to achieve the desired legibility. The palettes have been created in a way that if in a palette you are to select the colors of highest and lowest value, it should be possible to use one in the foreground and the other in the background. The result would be desireable.
